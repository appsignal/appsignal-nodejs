# AppSignal for Node.js Changelog

## 2.4.0

### Added

- [60d7980](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/60d79808a414a4c0fe4b80a76b099e22835516ee) minor - Add OpenTelemetry span processor for the mysql and mysql2 packages. These are experimental integrations and require additional set up to integrate with OpenTelemetry.
- [9cd1c8b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9cd1c8bfc315ec9ec8ecc7be1e1b867b0466f7a7) patch - Add config options for disabling default instrumentation like HTTP, HTTPS, PostgreSQL (pg package) and Redis (node-redis package).
  
  The following configuration options have been added:
  
  - `instrumentHttp`
  - `instrumentPg`
  - `instrumentRedis`
  
  By default these configuration options are set to `true`, which means the instrumentation is active by default. If you want to disable one of these instrumentations, configure it by setting the configuration option to `false`.
  
  ```js
  // appsignal.js
  // Brief example, see our docs for a full example
  
  const appsignal = new Appsignal({
    instrumentRedis: false // Disables the node-redis package instrumentation
  });
  ```
- [3959858](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3959858ec55ce67d19abb5abb52589a8948e39fd) patch - Add OpenTelemetry node-redis and ioredis query sanitizers. We recommend using these sanitizers to ensure no sensitive data is sent in query statements. Add the sanitizer to the `dbStatementSerializer` config as demonstrated below.
  
  ```js
  // tracing.js
  // Add the RedisDbStatementSerializer import
  const { RedisDbStatementSerializer } = require("@appsignal/nodejs");
  const { RedisInstrumentation } = require("@opentelemetry/instrumentation-redis");
  const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
    instrumentations: [
      new RedisInstrumentation({
        // Configure the AppSignal RedisDbStatementSerializer to sanitize queries
        dbStatementSerializer: RedisDbStatementSerializer
      })
    ]
  });
  ```
  
  The same can be done for the ioredis instrumentation:
  
  ```js
  // tracing.js
  // Add the IORedisDbStatementSerializer import
  const { IORedisDbStatementSerializer } = require('@appsignal/nodejs');
  const { IORedisInstrumentation } = require('@opentelemetry/instrumentation-ioredis');
  const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
    instrumentations: [
      // Add the IORedisInstrumentation
      new IORedisInstrumentation({
        // Configure the AppSignal IORedisDbStatementSerializer to sanitize queries
        dbStatementSerializer: IORedisDbStatementSerializer
      })
    ]
  });
  ```

### Changed

- [ee1ea8b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ee1ea8b7bcf557c2e236a234181fa461365f3071) patch - Use the OpenTelemetry SpanProcessor interface to build our own SpanProcessor. We previously copied the SpanProcessor code into our package, but instead we now use the OpenTelemetry interface directly. This should make our processor match the expected type better.
- [4e58a73](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4e58a734b3bf4354a38f7b5f697e8b17a86fb89f) patch - Bump agent to v-0b43802.
  
  - Add redis and ioredis OpenTelemetry instrumentation support.
- [01c25d3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/01c25d3415db0fafbe4b82a82a78327f5864c3b9) patch - Bump agent to v-1a8ac46
  
  - Support OpenTelemetry root span import.
  - Support OpenTelemetry HTTP instrumentation.
  - Support OpenTelemetry Express instrumentation.

### Fixed

- [8e45eba](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/8e45eba34b93b6b979a47298015ca20876a71bc3) patch - Fix the `ScopeManager.active()` function returning closed spans.
- [6d2e2d5](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/6d2e2d5b02d2684401368e87eb367e380f451eb7) patch - Do not transfer closed spans for new async contexts in the ScopeManager. Rather than relying on `ScopeManager.active()` and `ScopeManager.root()` to make sure the span is not already closed, also make sure it's not closed when transferring spans around between async contexts.

## 2.3.6

### Added

- [33f7864](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/33f78644295bca0a8395b7600798506498cd9229) patch - Add the `createRootSpan` function to the Tracer to allow explicit creation of RootSpans even if another RootSpan already exists and is tracked as the current RootSpan. Make sure to not forget about the previous RootSpan, and close it as well at some point when using this function.

## 2.3.5

### Changed

- [fc9f2fd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fc9f2fd1936ed8abf0dee8e419d4d7eaa32efb03) patch - Use the Node.js performance module as high-resolution timer for span creation and close times. This provides more accurate times and improves compatibility with other systems in the future.

### Fixed

- [c2931af](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/c2931af6f66e8036c179e9e1f67153321d897414) patch - When instrumenting an outgoing HTTP request, read the `host` property from the request options if the `hostname` property is not present. This fixes a bug where outgoing HTTP request hosts would be shown as `http://localhost`.
- [4c57751](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4c57751afce5abf0e771ee21c858ce30e60760f9) patch - Fix error on Microsoft Windows machines on install. The AppSignal extension still won't install on Windows, but now it won't cause an error while checking a development mode condition if it should build the TypeScript package.

## 2.3.4

### Changed

- [ff871bf](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ff871bf7f268f53b83f0de0fcc39c47b832fd9a9) patch - Update node-gyp to major version `9.0.0`. This drops compatibility with Python 2.7 for the extension install, but it makes it compatible with the latest Python 3 version, which should be more accessible to users going forward.

### Fixed

- [817fdb4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/817fdb4f6c20ca64fe33205c5d15098a93bda7e2) patch - Ensure the root span is preserved across scopes. Due to a bug in the scope management logic, calling `tracer.withSpan` could cause the root span for a given scope to be forgotten.

## 2.3.3

### Added

- [8f745e6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/8f745e6c7d5b70ab01b6cdf87ae0afcbe66850a6) patch - Log messages are now sent through a new centralized logger that writes to `/tmp/appsignal.log` by default.
  A warning is printed to STDERR when the default or provided logPath is not accessible, and the Logger
  automatically falls back to STDOUT. Use config option `log: stdout` to log AppSignal messages to STDOUT instead.

### Changed

- [9a7fafe](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9a7fafed628ee1931dd70640f4da9f8ae4bc740e) patch - Bump agent to v-bbc830a
  
  - Support batched statsd messages
  - Set start times for spans with traceparents
  - Check duration in transactions for negative and too high values
- [df63d2d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/df63d2d79e1d5829264fc17fe88e6cabfc10edfc) patch - Bump agent to v-f57e6cb
  
  - Enable process metrics on Heroku and Dokku

### Fixed

- [4a498be](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4a498be6f43d4ebe1cf786d14d21aae7ab19a9b3) patch - Allow nested values in `Span.setSampleData`. This change also allows
  values other than strings, integers and booleans to be passed as values
  within the sample data objects. Note that not all sample data keys allow
  nested values to be passed.
- [4ab4814](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4ab481483e86425d1b6c072c4f85f88768c792c6) patch - Follow redirects when downloading the AppSignal agent. This fixes an issue where the redirect page would be downloaded instead of the agent, causing the agent installation to fail.
- [17c0deb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/17c0deb277fa53ba5cbce2cd0623e2af58cccace) patch - Fix an issue where the AppSignal extension would throw an error when an object containing a non-integer number is sent to it. This would be triggered when calling `setSampleData` with an object containing a non-integer number, or when the values for a metric's tags are non-integer numbers.

## 2.3.2

### Changed

- [7a7e5c5](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7a7e5c5b494922084e15d8cb84dc9de8673c3d33) patch - Update the expected Span type in ScopeManager to `Span` from the `@appsignal/nodejs` package, rather than the `NodeSpan` from the `@appsignal/types` package. The type definition is the same, but now all Span types used by the Node.js integration are defined in the `@appsigna/nodejs` package.
- [7fc5e40](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7fc5e40befca0cde2edb6d56ee3a12ad58fec06d) patch - Improve memory usage when extension is not initialized. It will no longer initialize a new empty Tracer object when the extension is not loaded or AppSignal is not active.
- [47a851b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/47a851b380516b7ac2129ec294cf65ac6329c1bd) patch - Update @appsignal/types dependency to 3.0.0.

### Removed

- [32d8054](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/32d8054e5613e11a77fa3d98f246c72d3f98efa0) patch - Remove the private function `Span.toJSON`. This wasn't previously marked as private, but it was.
- [178b49a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/178b49ac0bef06cbf8915e7727a82c69a142372d) patch - Do not ship the extension install script test files in the published package. Reduces the package size a tiny bit.
- [0af54b7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/0af54b735e9ad4f7ceb22352008d07ebadcba1a9) patch - Remove the unused experimental module.

### Fixed

- [083a39a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/083a39a159ed60fbbd615486b3e596e27b700b4e) patch - Show errors in loading the extension when the `@appsignal/nodejs` module is required.
- [afe221e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/afe221e2a892d4dda068637a3f60ac31447ac33f) patch - The minutely probes are now stopped when `Appsignal.stop()` is called. This fixes an issue where Jest tests would warn about asynchronous operations that remain pending after the tests.

## 2.3.1

### Fixed

- [531e5bf](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/531e5bf14b078c9294d61c71cd62948bb3f3608c) patch - The supported Redis version is now locked to 3.x.x. This will prevent app startup failures for users
  with Redis 4.x.x.

## 2.3.0

### Added

- [6d1cfec](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/6d1cfec83e8ca19331aa114fe7f85b4ea5a179f0) patch - Implement unregister method for probes. You can now call the
  `probes.unregister(name)` method to unregister a probe by name.

### Changed

- [4c453cc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4c453ccf140c59090197a8ebfb79d39c77f31a91) minor - The extension package (@appsignal/nodejs-ext) is no longer a separated dependency.
  The extension is part of the @appsignal/nodejs package now.
- [675fa15](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/675fa1510dcc162adf87488fff07f237e2d3c8f0) patch - Update install report path location. The "nodejs" package now stores the install report in its own package path, with the rest of the extension files. This makes it easier to access by the diagnose report.
- [56fb794](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/56fb794a72e99d77f787000bf2a5bf95efc44565) patch - Improve the reporting of extension loading state in the diagnose report. Previously it would only report it as loaded when it was also running.
- [56fb794](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/56fb794a72e99d77f787000bf2a5bf95efc44565) patch - Change the way the extension is started. Previously it was started on initialization of the extension class (if the config was active), but now it's started by the client class.
- [733ee15](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/733ee15be5c548f8098a758307b70e58ae0b294f) patch - Remove the `os` and `cpu` fields from the `package.json`. This will prevent installations from failing on unlisted CPU architectures and Operating Systems. Our extension installer script will do this check instead. The package should not fail to install when it encounters an unsupported CPU architecture or Operating System.
- [ddc7e19](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ddc7e19277409552db671e68bdfd88fea95e8f57) patch - Update package metadata to specify the package repository.

### Fixed

- [fa955af](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fa955af0a6f4378b0ec06aec3305095334eb81ad) patch - Add a hostname tag to V8 probe metrics. This fixes an issue where metrics' values
  would be overriden between different hosts.
- [72c54a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/72c54a4e3cc04b6e0fb1bb1a8c87b657e4bc7a37) patch - Setting `enableMinutelyProbes` to `false` now disables the minutely probes
  system. Custom probes will not be called when the minutely probes are
  disabled. In addition, the `APPSIGNAL_ENABLE_MINUTELY_PROBES` environment
  variable can now be used to enable or disable the minutely probes.
  
  Before this change, setting `enableMinutelyProbes` to `false` would not
  register the default Node.js heap statistics minutely probe, but custom
  probes would still be called. To opt in for the previous behaviour,
  disabling only the Node.js heap statistics minutely probe without disabling
  custom probes, you can use the `probes.unregister()` method to unregister
  the default probe:
  
  ```js
  const probes = appsignal.metrics().probes();
  probes.unregister("v8_stats");
  ```
- [bb62525](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/bb62525f64530ba451a2f55a6ac1807e082b1d92) patch - Use the APPSIGNAL_ACTIVE environment variable to determine whether AppSignal is active.
- [f52a824](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/f52a824ea40625c60c136c705e0da74e195e6050) patch - Fix the extension function fallbacks on installation failure. When the extension fails to install and calls are made to the not loaded functions, it will no longer throw an error.

  from sending request params to AppSignal.
- [e5f4a97](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/e5f4a9744a315881a453ba06135e11f3d2a683c8) patch - Handle request errors in the internal HTTP transmitter used by diagnose tool
  and Push API key validator.

### Changed

- [7882541](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7882541f8e4c03bdf36a728d50dda07568a73815) patch - The extension is now responsible of determining if the process is running in a container. This check
  was previously made by the Node.js integration code.
- patch - Update @appsignal/nodejs-ext dependency to 2.0.6.

## 2.2.7

### Fixed

- [dc6cc13](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/dc6cc1371e85b8e5846839f50aeb382f7f4e0ae7) patch - Diagnose report config opts are now printed in camel case format,
  matching how the configuration options are provided to the `Appsignal` object
- [c1dae16](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/c1dae1623cb2a31940f1b845c420a4f9fea071ff) patch - Print deprecation message when passing a filename to `logPath` config option.
  This was already deprecated. Now it also prints a warning message on app start.
- [d72d600](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/d72d600f1d91ed7894fb014f899d90a38a033712) patch - The AppSignal client is stored on the global object as to make

- [bf69146](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/bf69146e25b06d70e3d7c07450f35f2016801114) patch - Fix TypeScript compatibility for global object augmentation.
- [df4163f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/df4163fc10e972934ff62fe7a1ac6cbcd0416335) patch - Add `filterParameters` and `filterSessionData` options to filter out specific parameter keys or session data keys. Previously only the (undocumented) `filterDataKeys` config option was available to filter out all kinds of sample data.
- [13068b7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/13068b7169cfc4dc285ac91757a1e121a75e0c95) patch - Rename the `apiKey` option to `pushApiKey` to match other AppSignal integrations.

  which request headers you want to be shown in sample detail views. The default is a list of common
  headers that do not include [personal identifiable information](https://docs.appsignal.com/appsignal/gdpr.html#allowed-request-headers-only).
  Read more about [request headers](https://docs.appsignal.com/application/header-filtering.html) on our documentation website.
- [2358c9f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/2358c9f20bb203af83d7961e37a11ce65c9f1be4) patch - Fix the diagnose's `log_dir_path` path check. It now always checks the actual log file's parent directory, rather than the configured path. These two values may differ as the package does a permission check to see if the `logPath` is writable or not.
- [3d6d23b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3d6d23bead6fd172845be2f7340a54ed5aa28542) patch - Fix writable check for paths in the diagnose report. Previously it only checked if a path was readable, not writable.

- [1d3eccc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1d3eccc86c05add0ef5d80d47228ab84d42edd89) patch - Fix diagnose report recognition when sent to the server. It was sent without an `api_key` parameter, which resulted in apps not being linked to the parent organization based on the known Push API key.
- [9171182](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9171182ac1d5c907df631ac5d00d729348527bb5) patch - Transmit the path file modes in the diagnose report as an octal number. Previously it send values like `33188` and now it transmits `100644`, which is a bit more human readable.

## 2.2.2

- [fbea22c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fbea22cd6f3a1e9d4c6e1b29446ee772025b6a0c) patch - Fix sending the agent diagnose report with all reports. It was sent, but with the wrong key, which made our server side validator report it as missing.
- [619b02a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/619b02a30b453b1cf44ad228a1e59233c06602dc) patch - Print agent diagnose report in diagnose CLI output.
- [1e35cf8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1e35cf8d814e0087b2e10dfcb463831c6d34b18e) patch - Add new config option to enable/disable StatsD server in the AppSignal agent. This new config option is called `enableStatsd` and is set to `false` by default. If set to `true`, the AppSignal agent will start a StatsD server on port 8125 on the host.

## 2.2.1

- [98f11a0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/98f11a0685f05676669ded7fa852536c59991e80) patch - The diagnose report will report parsing errors on reading or parsing the installation report. Previously, a missing installation report file would crash the diagnose tool.
- [e4215a1](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/e4215a119849a709fc44f8b5d1d2b96ea0e1a269) patch - Print String values in the diagnose report surrounded by quotes. Makes it more clear that it's a String value and not a label we print.
- [d0a05ae](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/d0a05ae9bcaeef6d4443e53952920774821aeb5c) patch - Correct the diagnose host section indenting, it was indented one level too far to the right when printed.

## 2.2.0

- [9c8319e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9c8319e7d014882b9d4fe609ac49e3918f4e0259) minor - Remove interface usage from @appsignal/types
  
  All Node.js-specific interfaces from the types package are now defined
  inside the nodejs core package. There's still a dependency from types
  package for common types as Func, HashMap, and HasMapValue.
  
  With this change, we keep taking advantage of interfaces, but now they're
  defined in a place where they're used.

## 2.1.1

- [42edcc0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/42edcc06b9258cc30ea13008d1f7ebc39332e28d) patch - Show correct language version in diagnose's extension installation section. It did not show the language version used during install, but the current one used to run the diagnose tool.
- [99b2f6c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/99b2f6cd6ca743d42c59587a05e979efe080797a) patch - Rename the `Agent` module to `Extension` to fit better with our naming standards.
- [ad6be4f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ad6be4f38a6caff7fdfa06ae1d1ef51145bc004d) patch - Fix diagnose installation status reporting. It previously always reported "success", but will now also print failures.
- patch - Update @appsignal/nodejs-ext dependency to 2.0.2.

## 2.1.0

- [723b98d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/723b98d1370cb74d3d0198f4c7d49d08691095c2) minor - Add rootSpan and setError helpers.
  
  Errors added to child spans are ignored by the agent. Now the rootSpan is
  always accessible from the tracer object as well as setError. The setError
  function allows to track errors on demand and they will be always attached
  to the main current span, so they don't get ignored by the agent.
- [f0256d3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/f0256d3979fef129ded0644e712efbb96036967a) patch - Bug fix in custom timestamp calculation
- [1f182a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1f182a49548322b8af8ecec59ca5efe85cbebc29) patch - Deprecate the addError function on the Span interface. Instead use the Tracer's `setError` function to set the error on the root span.
- [96df8a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/96df8a43d7e9061233ac9ff9e5f2dde3c8d83ff7) patch - Add sendError helper to Tracer object.
  
  This new helper allows you to track an error separately from any other span
  inside the current context. Or use it to set up in your own error handling to
  report errors in a catch-statement if no performance monitoring is needed.
  
  ```js
  try {
    // Do complex stuff
  } catch (error) {
    appsignal.tracer().sendError(error, span => {
      span.setName("daily.task"); // Set a recognizable action name
      span.set("user_id", user_id); // Set custom tags
    });
  }
  ```

  filename.
- [baa2b7f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/baa2b7fb46aaa42a0e7d953276df3965968f733f) patch - Limit the `appsignal.log` file size in diagnose report. It will only send the last 2MiB of the file. This prevents the diagnose report from sending too much data that it gets rejected by the server.
- [7bb5398](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7bb5398af34a46038b52fede68c5746df9db71e0) patch - Fix the validation of Push API key in the diagnose report. It would always print "valid" even if the key was not set or invalid.

  to AppSignal's servers off--with `--send-report` and `--no-send-report`.
  
  By default, the report is not sent if you don't pass `--send-report`.
