# AppSignal for Node.js Changelog

## 3.6.5

_Published on 2025-05-05._

### Changed

- Remove redundant cron check-in pairs. When more than one pair of start and finish cron check-in events is reported for the same identifier in the same period, only one of them will be reported to AppSignal. (patch [1cfcc0a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1cfcc0a506971b293bb18a313d0b6e91776aabab))

## 3.6.4

_Published on 2025-03-31._

### Added

- Add support for OpenTelemetry histograms. (patch [2ff4e94](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/2ff4e94e69479b3dfdfd07b4130d6e787f959671))
- Add support for Node.js 23 (patch [2bd47b9](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/2bd47b9b1664f3024109c123eb226f37f9557c70))

### Removed

## 3.6.3

_Published on 2025-03-14._

### Changed

- Improve SQL sanitisation for functions and numbered placeholders. (patch [b01e6c6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/b01e6c64c65921ca04a324e02e7c0cd65d4e3848))

## 3.6.2

_Published on 2025-03-11._

### Changed

- Delay and eventually halt agent reboots by the extension.

  The AppSignal extension is responsible for booting the AppSignal agent. If communication with the agent is lost, the extension is responsible for rebooting it.

  In certain scenarios, such as when several processes with different AppSignal configurations are misconfigured to share the same working directory, the processes' extensions can enter a loop of rebooting and killing each others' agents. These short-lived agents may then attempt to repeatedly send pending payloads to AppSignal in quick succession.

  This change causes the extension to delay each reboot of its agent by one additional second, and to no longer attempt to reboot the agent after the tenth reboot, slowing down and eventually breaking this loop.

  (patch [ff392c6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ff392c67ef95c5b1c5574d230a67ce919c492ab6))

## 3.6.1

_Published on 2025-02-27._

### Changed

- Update Prisma instrumentation to version 6.4. This improves compatibility with new Prisma versions. (patch [930b3db](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/930b3db2bb9cca504184a8931acea1434caded12), [61316bf](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/61316bff15200a72859e717d88a68c929abb97f4))

## 3.6.0

### Changed

- [e2498ad](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/e2498ad0462f453e10689558646d2967445baa7e) patch - Update span recognition following the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions 1.30 database specification. We now also sanitize SQL queries in the `db.query.text` attribute and Redis queries in the `db.operation.name` attribute.
- [282d9ac](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/282d9ac048b5284d3376b95fe08b23ec5f69f041) patch - Bump the log message when no span is active and one of our sample data helpers are used like `setParams`, `setSessionData`, `setCustomData`, etc from debug to warning.
- [753a630](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/753a6304d72c93081a92bea46968e57cdc17d283) patch - Update bundled trusted root certificates

### Removed

- [e2498ad](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/e2498ad0462f453e10689558646d2967445baa7e) minor - Remove the OpenTelemetry beta feature in favor of the new [AppSignal collector](https://docs.appsignal.com/collector). If you are using the AppSignal agent to send OpenTelemetry data in our public beta through the `/enriched` endpoint on the agent's HTTP server, please migrate to the collector to continue using the beta. The collector has a much better implementation of this feature for the beta.

## 3.5.5

_Published on 2024-12-20._

### Fixed

- Fix a performance issue when sanitising `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` queries. (patch [9772e93](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9772e9316db5fb7c73cdf29dd9441708ea65cf74))

## 3.5.4

_Published on 2024-11-22._

### Fixed

- Allow Pino transport to be used as a transport. Before, our Pino transport could only be used as a destination:

  ```js
  import pino from "pino";
  import { Appsignal, AppsignalPinoTransport } from "@appsignal/nodejs";

  pino(AppsignalPinoTransport({
    client: Appsignal.client,
    group: "pino"
  }));
  ```

  This meant it was not possible to log both to our transport and to another destination.

  Now, it is also possible to use it as a Pino transport, with the `transport` Pino config option or the `pino.transport()` function:

  ```js
  import pino from "pino";

  pino({
    transport: {
      target: "@appsignal/nodejs/pino",
      options: {
        group: "pino"
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  It is no longer necessary to pass the AppSignal client to the Pino transport. AppSignal must be active for the Pino transport to work.

  By enabling its use as a transport, it is now possible to use it alongside other transports:

  ```js
  pino({
    transport: {
      targets: [
        // Send logs to AppSignal...
        { target: "@appsignal/nodejs/pino" },
        // ... and to standard output!
        { target: "pino/file" }
      ]
    }
  });
  ```

  (patch [11b789d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/11b789d924788abf97460727da18ab75c611b361))

## 3.5.3

_Published on 2024-11-07._

### Added

- Set the app revision config option for Scalingo deploys automatically. If the `CONTAINER_VERSION` system environment variable is present, it will use used to set the `revision` config option automatically. Overwrite it's value by configuring the `revision` config option for your application. (patch [5b90b64](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/5b90b64215ef753a32da60cb51f6b8d41a5a5890))

### Fixed

- Fix an issue where the extension fails to build on ARM64 Linux. (patch [69fcdcf](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/69fcdcf72616520f34e72dfc68af8e003f3c40e0))

## 3.5.2

### Added

- [e20653b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/e20653bcd6343bd55ac9fccdfe383cb94af019db) patch - Add Fastify v5 compatibility

## 3.5.1

_Published on 2024-10-16._

### Added

- [46a6ad1](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/46a6ad14a51cd157ae3fbafe8f2e3e8959b2e89b) patch - A Pino transport is now available. If Pino is your main logger, you can now use the AppSignal pino transport to send those logs to AppSignal.
  
  ```js
  import pino from "pino"
  import { Appsignal, AppsignalPinoTransport } from "@appsignal/nodejs"
  
  const logger = pino(
    AppsignalPinoTransport({
      client: Appsignal.client,
      group: "application",
    })
  )
  ```

### Changed

- [1bafde8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1bafde8010cebe3705812311387c2559e372c25f) patch - Change the primary download mirror for integrations.

## 3.5.0

_Published on 2024-09-26._

### Added

- Add support for heartbeat check-ins.

  Use the `checkIn.heartbeat` method to send a single heartbeat check-in event from your application. This can be used, for example, in your application's main loop:

  ```js
  import { checkIn } from "@appsignal/nodejs"

  while (true) {
    checkIn.heartbeat("job_processor")
    await processJob()
  }
  ```

  Heartbeats are deduplicated and sent asynchronously, without blocking the current thread. Regardless of how often the `.heartbeat` method is called, at most one heartbeat with the same identifier will be sent every ten seconds.

  Pass `{continuous: true}` as the second argument to send heartbeats continuously during the entire lifetime of the current process. This can be used, for example, after your application has finished its boot process:

  ```js
  import { checkIn } from "@appsignal/nodejs"

  function main() {
    checkIn.heartbeat("job_processor", {continuous: true})
    startApp()
  }
  ```

  (minor [839073e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/839073e8c3a13956e7ec5019039095e15a7cf402))

### Changed

- Send check-ins concurrently. When calling `Appsignal.checkIn.cron`, instead of blocking the current process while the check-in events are sent, schedule them to be sent in a separate process. (patch [a61d16b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/a61d16b46b5db519db87db1dd0e93b52bb65f908))
- Do not block Node.js shutdown. It is no longer necessary to call `Appsignal.stop` for the Node.js engine to allow itself to shut down. It should still be called and awaited in production scenarios and at the end of scripts, as it ensures that scheduled check-ins are delivered. (patch [0f438d6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/0f438d65c87c5f43955f696f3d4feed397e673c3))

## 3.4.9

_Published on 2024-08-14._

### Changed

- Rename heartbeats to cron check-ins. Calls to `Appsignal.heartbeat` and `Appsignal.Heartbeat` should be replaced with calls to `Appsignal.checkIn.cron` and `Appsignal.checkIn.Cron`, for example:

  ```js
  // Before
  import { heartbeat } from "@appsignal/nodejs"

  heartbeat("do_something", () => {
    do_something()
  })

  // After
  import { checkIn } from "@appsignal/nodejs"

  checkIn.cron("do_something", () => {
    do_something
  })
  ```

  (patch [fc9abba](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fc9abbab04d071edea36ec7440236165529e57be))

### Deprecated

- Calls to `Appsignal.heartbeat` and to the `Appsignal.Heartbeat` constructor will emit a deprecation warning. (patch [fc9abba](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fc9abbab04d071edea36ec7440236165529e57be))

### Fixed

- Prevent internal AppSignal requests from being instrumented and appearing in the "Slow API requests" panel. (patch [95bf139](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/95bf1397226864704843a6354fe49e3971511e72))

## 3.4.8

_Published on 2024-07-04._

### Fixed

- Fix different spans of the same category incorrectly being reported with the same body. (patch [100e964](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/100e964310b56b1efc32459ac83d7b6a3c77be65))

## 3.4.7

### Changed

- [b22eecd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/b22eecd5d507f5297869fca219ca930a150b1390) patch - Update OpenTelemetry dependencies.

## 3.4.6

_Published on 2024-06-14._

### Fixed

- [0d60a9b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/0d60a9bc05a4dd792ea69485b30219d1dfef0655) patch - Fix an issue where a later span close time than accurate, and therefore a longer span duration, is reported to AppSignal under certain circumstances.

## 3.4.5

_Published on 2024-06-12._

### Added

- [388cade](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/388cade65ac36114854e95321d608031091c1156) patch - Add BullMQ support through the `@appsignal/opentelemetry-instrumentation-bullmq` instrumentation. AppSignal will automatically instrument the use of BullMQ in your application.
  
  Calls to functions that enqueue jobs, such as `Queue.add` and others, will be instrumented as an event in the event timeline for the performance sample in which it takes place.
  
  When a BullMQ `Worker` processes a job, this will result in a performance sample in the `background` namespace.
- [388cade](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/388cade65ac36114854e95321d608031091c1156) patch - Add basic OpenTelemetry messaging support. This adds support for any OpenTelemetry instrumentation that complies with the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions specification for messaging.

### Changed

- [388cade](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/388cade65ac36114854e95321d608031091c1156) patch - Rename the `hostname` tag, which contains the host of the URI that an HTTP request was made against, to `request_host`.
  
  This fixes an issue where the `hostname` tag would later be internally overriden to the hostname of the machine processing the request, but notifications would still be emitted containing the previous `hostname` value.
- [1a01c5d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1a01c5d7a2e8676f3fecada994d7c2599b17a2a5) patch - Improve the amqlib instrumentation by parsing it like other messaging spans following the OpenTelemetry messaging spec.

### Fixed

- [1a01c5d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1a01c5d7a2e8676f3fecada994d7c2599b17a2a5) patch - Fix an issue where Redis events are misidentified as HTTP events.

## 3.4.4

### Added

- [138f01f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/138f01ff69ca252319643907c9c221faf465fa27) patch - Instrument calls to `fetch` in Node.js. Requests made using Node.js' global `fetch`, or through the underlying `undici` library, will be automatically instrumented and shown as events in your performance samples' event timeline.

## 3.4.3

_Published on 2024-05-14._

### Added

- [cca6741](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/cca6741208253bae4e9716d6ffcb439711283403) patch - Instrument calls to `fetch` in Node.js. Requests made using Node.js' global `fetch`, or through the underlying `undici` library, will be automatically instrumented and shown as events in your performance samples' event timeline.
- [cca6741](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/cca6741208253bae4e9716d6ffcb439711283403) patch - Support Kamal-based deployments. Read the `KAMAL_VERSION` environment variable, which Kamal exposes within the deployed container, if present, and use it as the application revision if it is not set. This will automatically report deploy markers for applications using Kamal.

### Changed

- [6bf596c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/6bf596c7f07fec6652e8c9aa64cc1604b9e984b3) patch - ### Improve error reporting during initialisation
  
  Do not report an error with the extension installation when AppSignal is imported -- instead, report it when attempting to initialise AppSignal. Do not report an error with the extension if AppSignal is not configured to be active.
  
  When AppSignal does not start due to its configuration (`active` is set to `false`, or the push API key is missing) report the specific reason why.

### Fixed

- [24a8701](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/24a87016077207a2c02590f8b1bab09c8b57e8ce) patch - Improve compatibility with alternative package managers. Fix an issue where AppSignal would fail to install with Yarn when using package managers that require transitive dependencies to be declared.

## 3.4.2

### Added

- [3868536](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3868536ec201fb66dcb1a44352356f9fd74e0547) patch - Ignore AMQP spans if they're root spans.
- [27c1ca7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/27c1ca7027fb65289d2980e7173d07cca1c1454d) patch - The AMQP protocol is now instrumented when using amqplib. The AppSignal client automatically instruments and creates spans when using `amqplib`. Packages using amqplib such as Rascal are supported.

### Changed

- [3868536](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3868536ec201fb66dcb1a44352356f9fd74e0547) patch - Log debug messages when metrics are received for easier debugging.

## 3.4.1

_Published on 2024-04-24._

### Fixed

- [7e6f79d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7e6f79d2fdec659eb469cdc08c1c493145752356) patch - Fix an issue where internal Next.js traces were not correctly ignored in certain circumstances.

## 3.4.0

_Published on 2024-04-22._

### Added

- [81bd0a9](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/81bd0a95fc696d49228cc1375a4e59058d7ecbe1) minor - _Heartbeats are currently only available to beta testers. If you are interested in trying it out, [send an email to support@appsignal.com](mailto:support@appsignal.com?subject=Heartbeat%20beta)!_
  
  ---
  
  Add heartbeats support. You can send heartbeats directly from your code, to
  track the execution of certain processes:
  
  ```javascript
  import { heartbeat } from "@appsignal/nodejs"
  
  function sendInvoices() {
    // ... your code here ...
    heartbeat("send_invoices")
  }
  ```
  
  You can pass a function to `heartbeat`, to report to AppSignal both when the
  process starts, and when it finishes, allowing you to see the duration of the
  process:
  
  ```javascript
  import { heartbeat } from "@appsignal/nodejs"
  
  function sendInvoices() {
    heartbeat("send_invoices", () => {
      // ... your code here ...
    })
  }
  ```
  
  If an exception is raised within the function, the finish event will not be
  reported to AppSignal, triggering a notification about the missing heartbeat.
  The exception will bubble outside of the heartbeat function.
  
  If the function passed to `heartbeat` returns a promise, the finish event will
  be reported to AppSignal if the promise resolves. This means that you can use
  heartbeats to track the duration of async functions:
  
  ```javascript
  import { heartbeat } from "@appsignal/nodejs"
  
  async function sendInvoices() {
    await heartbeat("send_invoices", async () => {
      // ... your async code here ...
    })
  }
  ```
  
  If the promise is rejected, or if it never resolves, the finish event will
  not be reported to AppSignal.
- [9985d08](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9985d08044c4cdd9ecdeff16ab40d68e852aa662) patch - Implement the `ignoreLogs` configuration option, which can also be configured as the `APPSIGNAL_IGNORE_LOGS` environment variable.
  
  The value of `ignoreLogs` is a list (comma-separated, when using the environment variable) of log line messages that should be ignored. For example, the value `"start"` will cause any message containing the word "start" to be ignored. Any log line message containing a value in `ignoreLogs` will not be reported to AppSignal.
  
  The values can use a small subset of regular expression syntax (specifically, `^`, `$` and `.*`) to narrow or expand the scope of lines that should be matched.
  
  For example, the value `"^start$"` can be used to ignore any message that is _exactly_ the word "start", but not messages that merely contain it, like "Process failed to start". The value `"Task .* succeeded"` can be used to ignore messages about task success regardless of the specific task name.

### Changed

- [6224018](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/62240184e81840a7c5722bde55e386ac15f88e0c) patch - `Appsignal.stop()` now returns a promise. For your application to wait until
  AppSignal has been gracefully stopped, this promise must be awaited:
  
  ```javascript
  import { Appsignal } from "@appsignal/nodejs"
  
  await Appsignal.stop()
  process.exit(0)
  ```
  
  In older Node.js versions where top-level await is not available, terminate
  the application when the promise is settled:
  
  ```javascript
  import { Appsignal } from "@appsignal/nodejs"
  
  Appsignal.stop().finally(() => {
    process.exit(0)
  })
  ```

- [232ad25](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/232ad25657b82566b0da9df5bde3cd1a4074f074) minor - The OpenTelemetry metric exporter is now initialized by default. The integration will send default metrics from the instrumentations, and also allows you to send your custom metrics using OpenTelemetry to AppSignal to build your own dashboards.

### Changed

- [56fae90](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/56fae90bda5223c873b857f8787a74d02a88b24a) patch - Make the debug log message for OpenTelemetry spans from libraries we don't automatically recognize more clear. Mention the span id and the instrumentation library.

### Changed

- [6b75b87](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/6b75b87152689b094294d2b2d989d042facfb422) patch - Fix disk usage returning a Vec with no entries on Alpine Linux when the `df --local` command fails.

### Removed

- [6b75b87](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/6b75b87152689b094294d2b2d989d042facfb422) patch - Remove the `appsignal_set_host_gauge` and `appsignal_set_process_gauge` extension functions. These functions were already deprecated and did not report any metrics.

### Fixed

- [c49dbf3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/c49dbf3d242bbdc89423dad1aa4027b5f4a51569) patch - Fix the demo sample recognition. Demo samples didn't show the helpful explanation box in the UI, because the `demo_sample` tag was set incorrectly as an attribute.

## 3.0.29

### Changed

- [ec9c4fb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ec9c4fb9ba8db544630b507e8e77207c17f60f14) patch - Update OpenTelemetry dependencies. This fixes a known issue with Next.js and webpack compatibility and includes other fixes.

## 3.0.28

### Fixed

- [72e9e73](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/72e9e731b3a28155fe7c77d67ae619f649bfeec1) patch - Update the diagnose tool URLs printed by the CLI and package to the new location in our documentation.
- [96b8545](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/96b8545323195ee5857a18190c5138834e51756f) patch - Fix compatibility issue with Node.js's node-gyp package and Python 3.12.0. Python 3.12.0 removed a package called "distutils", causing the extension to fail to install. Upgrade the node-gyp package with the fix for this issue.

## 3.0.27

### Changed

- [5c460cc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/5c460ccda90e128a8560c53f0094684fd31c00d6) patch - Remove `route` tag from HTTP server spans. Since the span will already have the route attribute as part of its name, the tag is redundant.
- [5c460cc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/5c460ccda90e128a8560c53f0094684fd31c00d6) patch - Filter more disk mountpoints for disk usage and disk IO stats. This helps reduce noise in the host metrics by focussing on more important mountpoints.
  
  The following mountpoint are ignored. Any mountpoint containing:
  
  - `/etc/hostname`
  - `/etc/hosts`
  - `/etc/resolv.conf`
  - `/snap/`
  - `/proc/`

### Fixed

- [5c460cc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/5c460ccda90e128a8560c53f0094684fd31c00d6) patch - Fix an issue where the `method` tag extracted from an incoming HTTP request span would be overriden with the method used for an outgoing HTTP request span.
- [5c460cc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/5c460ccda90e128a8560c53f0094684fd31c00d6) patch - - Support disk usage reporting (using `df`) on Alpine Linux. This host metric would report an error on Alpine Linux.
  - When a disk mountpoint has no inodes usage percentage, skip the mountpoint, and report the inodes information successfully for the inodes that do have an inodes usage percentage.
- [7ec2008](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7ec20087293a6809f54b01097b87624d6c72042e) patch - Fix missing error metrics for the error rate and error count graphs in some scenarios, like with Koa apps.

## 3.0.26

### Changed

- [89db29f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/89db29fe35731d4b014f8efbf4a8151530132853) patch - Bump agent to eec7f7b
  
  Updated the probes dependency to 0.5.2. CPU usage is now normalized to the number of CPUs available to the container. This means that a container with 2 CPUs will have its CPU usage reported as 50% when using 1 CPU instead of 100%. This is a breaking change for anyone using the cpu probe.
  
  If you have CPU triggers set up based on the old behaviour, you might need to update those to these new normalized values to get the same behaviour. Note that this is needed only if the AppSignal integration package you're using includes this change.

## 3.0.25

### Added

- [ab7f3c7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ab7f3c73308b77a9573bb7fb74e18a34fa95be35) patch - Add `initializeOpentelemetrySdk` configuration option. This allows those who
  would rather take control of how OpenTelemetry is initialised in their
  application to skip AppSignal's initialization of the OpenTelemetry SDK.
  
  Additionally, add an `opentelemetryInstrumentations` method on the client,
  which returns AppSignal's default OpenTelemetry instrumentations, already
  configured to work correctly with AppSignal. The provided list of
  instrumentations will follow the `additionalInstrumentations` and
  `disableDefaultInstrumentations` config options, if those are set.
  
  This is not the recommended way to use AppSignal for Node.js. Only use this
  config option and this method if you're really sure that you know what
  you're doing.
  
  When initialising OpenTelemetry, it is necessary to add the AppSignal span
  processor in order for data to be sent to AppSignal. For example, using the
  OpenTelemetry SDK:
  
  ```js
  import { SpanProcessor, Appsignal } from "@appsignal/nodejs";
  // or: const { SpanProcessor, Appsignal } = require("@appsignal/nodejs")
  
  const sdk = new NodeSDK({
    spanProcessor: new SpanProcessor(Appsignal.client)
    instrumentations: Appsignal.client.opentelemetryInstrumentations()
  });
  
  sdk.start()
  ```
  
  The above snippet assumes that the AppSignal client has been initialised
  beforehand.
  
  When making use of this config option, the OpenTelemetry instrumentations
  must be configured in the same way as it is done in the AppSignal integration.
  In the above snippet, the `instrumentations` property in the OpenTelemetry SDK
  is set to the AppSignal client's list of OpenTelemetry instrumentations, which
  are configured to work correctly with AppSignal.
- [daa8982](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/daa898225e0594b9b4831da08c84f139cf842166) patch - Add the `setSqlBody` tracing helper to set the body attribute on a span that contains a SQL query. When using this helper the given SQL query will be sanitized, reducing the chances of sending sensitive data to AppSignal.
  
  ```js
  import { setSqlBody } from "@appsignal/nodejs";
  
  // Must be used in an instrumented context -- e.g. an Express route
  setSqlBody("SELECT * FROM users WHERE 'password' = 'secret'");
  // Will be stored as: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE 'password' = ?"
  ```
  
  When the `setBody` helper is also used, the `setSqlBody` overwrites the `setBody` attribute.
  
  More information about our [tracing helpers](https://docs.appsignal.com/nodejs/3.x/instrumentation/instrumentation.html) can be found in our documentation.

### Changed

- [33bce2e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/33bce2e837505b8beaa140c578816aa7007c3569) patch - Bump agent to b604345.
  
  - Add an exponential backoff to the retry sleep time to bind to the StatsD, NGINX and OpenTelemetry exporter ports. This gives the agent a longer time to connect to the ports if they become available within a 4 minute window.
  - Changes to the agent logger:
    - Logs from the agent and extension now use a more consistent format in logs for spans and transactions.
    - Logs that are for more internal use are moved to the trace log level and logs that are useful for debugging most support issues are moved to the debug log level. It should not be necessary to use log level 'trace' as often anymore. The 'debug' log level should be enough.
  - Add `running_in_container` to agent diagnose report, to be used primarily by the Python package as a way to detect if an app's host is a container or not.
  
  Bump agent to 8260fa1.
  
  - Add `appsignal.sql_body` magic span attribute for OpenTelemetry spans. When this attribute is detected, we store the value as the span/event body. This span is sanitized beforehand so it doesn't contain any sensitive data and helps to group events in our backend. When used in combination with the `appsignal.body` attribute, the new `appsignal.sql_body` attribute is leading.
  
  More information on [AppSignal OpenTelemetry span attributes](https://docs.appsignal.com/opentelemetry/custom-instrumentation/attributes.html) can be found in our docs.
- [285f89e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/285f89e732a552a5ec8f2ca627d492b7d0d2ea19) patch - Print more path details in the diagnose CLI output. It will now print details like if a path exists, the ownership of a path and if it's writable or not to help debug issues locally.
- [3204cdd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3204cdd597cc342343aae434ca0de277418e08e2) patch - Bump agent to 1dd2a18.
  
  - When adding an SQL body attribute via the extension, instead of truncating the body first and sanitising it later, sanitise it first and truncate it later. This prevents an issue where queries containing very big values result in truncated sanitisations.

### Fixed

- [3367dfe](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3367dfe583f4c2104f6f4b1e223eda88c58d88a1) patch - Fix a TypeScript types compatibility error upon app compilation when using the AppSignal Express error handler.

## 3.0.0

Welcome to AppSignal for Node.js version 3.0.0.!

In this release, we have switched to using OpenTelemetry internally for tracing. (We do not yet support OpenTelemetry for metrics and logging, but do continue to support metrics through our own metrics system.) The AppSignal instrumentation packages `@appsignal/express`, `@appsignal/koa`, `@appsignal/nextjs` and `@appsignal/apollo-server` should no longer be used. Some official OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages are bundled with our package as dependencies and instrumented automatically. Other _supported instrumentation packages_ can be [added and configured manually](https://docs.appsignal.com/nodejs/3.x/instrumentation/additional-instrumentations.html).

We strongly recommend following the [migration guide] while upgrading. Instrumentation from package version 2 is not compatible with version 3. Custom instrumentation will need to be set up using [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://docs.appsignal.com/nodejs/3.x/instrumentation/instrumentation.html).

If you run into any issues upgrading to this new version, please contact us at [support@appsignal.com][support] for help.

## 3.0.0-beta.1

### Added

- [ded7a82](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ded7a821332efd3e97a0867adcdd60f58fdd30a2) major - Add OpenTelemetry support to the AppSignal Node.js integration. This new major release uses OpenTelemetry to support tracing instrumentation. The old `@appsignal/<package name>` instrumentation packages are not compatible. Please remove them before upgrading.

### Changed

- [d452b46](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/d452b4670b03eb8d9101684eb7188eb091fb37ea) patch - Support OpenTelemetry root spans in SpanProcessor. This change makes AppSignal instrumentation (like Express/Koa.js/Next.js) no longer a requirement. In fact you will need to use the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for those libraries from now on.
- [60428c8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/60428c8932602649fbaf54e5d9c19caa773f07c1) patch - Bump agent to v-d573c9b
  
  - Display unsupported OpenTelemetry spans in limited form.
  - Clean up payload storage before sending. Should fix issues with locally queued payloads blocking data from being sent.
  - Add `appsignal_create_opentelemetry_span` function to create spans for further modification, rather than only import them.
- [a1d947c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/a1d947c9d25055d9198600c54b1bceb28b322ad8) patch - Remove the mysql2 package peer dependency. It's not only present as a development dependency for the package.
- [54491fa](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/54491fa04c75e536fc2010b3df1c1f33037af4d2) patch - Bump agent to 06391fb
  
  - Accept "warning" value for the `log_level` config option.
  - Add aarch64 Linux musl build. Doesn't work for Node.js package.
  - Improve debug logging from the extension.
  - Fix high CPU issue for appsignal-agent when nothing could be read from the socket.

### Removed

- [2b95a68](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/2b95a6883c0da65f865b17be4e73856845d51d64) major - Remove `debug` config option. This has been replaced with `logLevel` set to `debug`.
- [13bc306](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/13bc306bd02d9b2f1fb124239444f7611c68d379) major - Remove the `apiKey` config option. This has been renamed to `pushApiKey`.

### Fixed

- [d452b46](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/d452b4670b03eb8d9101684eb7188eb091fb37ea) patch - Improve the error message on extension load failure. The error message will now print more details about the installed and expected architecture when they mismatch. This is most common on apps mounted on a container after first being installed on the host with a different architecture than the container.
- [fa13d19](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fa13d198ed42eb23674732f4e17ba4b4595cea39) patch - Accept uppercase input in diagnose tool send report prompt. When prompted to send the report when the diagnose tool, it will now also accept uppercase values like "Y" and "N".

## 2.4.2

### Changed

- [b7382d7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/b7382d7ee40729a0e9eea32e59daed4e69f688bf) patch - Do not restore closed spans from within the `withSpan` helper. If a previously active span gets closed while `withSpan` has another span as currently active, do not restore the closed span when the callback has finished.
- [7a7bc9b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7a7bc9b62d5c9f021cfe337b520eac875a5b4c5f) patch - Do not restore root span after `withSpan` callback has finished. Previously the root span was restored to the original root span before the `withSpan` helper was called. This has been changed, because the `withSpan` helper is only about changing the active span, not the root span. If a new root span has been set within a `withSpan` helper callback, the root span will no longer be restored. We recommend setting a new root span before calling `withSpan` instead.
  
  ```js
  const rootSpan = tracer.rootSpan()
  const span = tracer.createSpan(...)
  tracer.withSpan(span, function(span) {
    tracer.createRootSpan(...)
  });
  // No longer match
  rootSpan != tracer.rootSpan()
  ```

### Fixed

- [8a32a21](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/8a32a2146862451028a5228534ffeb1a32e2f7a9) patch - Only allow open root spans to be set as root. This avoids closed root spans to be reused in child contexts.
- [4b74e2f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4b74e2f63910bd8875b5000f059f3ddb02452a43) patch - Don't return closed spans in `withSpan` helper. If a closed span was given to the `witSpan` helper it would temporarily overwrite the context with a closed span that cannot be modified. Instead it will return the current active span, if any. If no span was active it will return a `NoopSpan`.
- [1731c8e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1731c8ec55a54bab174b49be514edcd3a533cb8f) patch - Add `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base` package runtime dependency. Our OpenTelemetry SpanProcessor needs this package at runtime, not just at compile time.

## 2.4.1

### Fixed

- [d92583f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/d92583f698bc7aae8648a564f3da914ac3b97097) patch - Do not instrument HTTP requests to the default socket.io path. This works around an issue where our HTTP instrumentation breaks socket.io's server side, causing the client side to get stuck in a connection loop.
- [3d22f15](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3d22f15371c3eaf32843e69184455c11b8b8e68a) patch - Fix removing event listeners from wrapped event emitters. When using
  `tracer.wrapEmitter` to wrap an event emitter, it was not possible to remove
  any listeners that were added after the event emitter was wrapped.

## 2.4.0

### Added

- [60d7980](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/60d79808a414a4c0fe4b80a76b099e22835516ee) minor - Add OpenTelemetry span processor for the mysql and mysql2 packages. These are experimental integrations and require additional set up to integrate with OpenTelemetry.
- [9cd1c8b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9cd1c8bfc315ec9ec8ecc7be1e1b867b0466f7a7) patch - Add config options for disabling default instrumentation like HTTP, HTTPS, PostgreSQL (pg package) and Redis (node-redis package).
  
  The following configuration options have been added:
  
  - `instrumentHttp`
  - `instrumentPg`
  - `instrumentRedis`
  
  By default these configuration options are set to `true`, which means the instrumentation is active by default. If you want to disable one of these instrumentations, configure it by setting the configuration option to `false`.
  
  ```js
  // appsignal.js
  // Brief example, see our docs for a full example
  
  const appsignal = new Appsignal({
    instrumentRedis: false // Disables the node-redis package instrumentation
  });
  ```
- [3959858](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/3959858ec55ce67d19abb5abb52589a8948e39fd) patch - Add OpenTelemetry node-redis and ioredis query sanitizers. We recommend using these sanitizers to ensure no sensitive data is sent in query statements. Add the sanitizer to the `dbStatementSerializer` config as demonstrated below.
  
  ```js
  // tracing.js
  // Add the RedisDbStatementSerializer import
  const { RedisDbStatementSerializer } = require("@appsignal/nodejs");
  const { RedisInstrumentation } = require("@opentelemetry/instrumentation-redis");
  const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
    instrumentations: [
      new RedisInstrumentation({
        // Configure the AppSignal RedisDbStatementSerializer to sanitize queries
        dbStatementSerializer: RedisDbStatementSerializer
      })
    ]
  });
  ```
  
  The same can be done for the ioredis instrumentation:
  
  ```js
  // tracing.js
  // Add the IORedisDbStatementSerializer import
  const { IORedisDbStatementSerializer } = require('@appsignal/nodejs');
  const { IORedisInstrumentation } = require('@opentelemetry/instrumentation-ioredis');
  const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
    instrumentations: [
      // Add the IORedisInstrumentation
      new IORedisInstrumentation({
        // Configure the AppSignal IORedisDbStatementSerializer to sanitize queries
        dbStatementSerializer: IORedisDbStatementSerializer
      })
    ]
  });
  ```

### Changed

- [ee1ea8b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ee1ea8b7bcf557c2e236a234181fa461365f3071) patch - Use the OpenTelemetry SpanProcessor interface to build our own SpanProcessor. We previously copied the SpanProcessor code into our package, but instead we now use the OpenTelemetry interface directly. This should make our processor match the expected type better.
- [4e58a73](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4e58a734b3bf4354a38f7b5f697e8b17a86fb89f) patch - Bump agent to v-0b43802.
  
  - Add redis and ioredis OpenTelemetry instrumentation support.
- [01c25d3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/01c25d3415db0fafbe4b82a82a78327f5864c3b9) patch - Bump agent to v-1a8ac46
  
  - Support OpenTelemetry root span import.
  - Support OpenTelemetry HTTP instrumentation.
  - Support OpenTelemetry Express instrumentation.

### Fixed

- [8e45eba](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/8e45eba34b93b6b979a47298015ca20876a71bc3) patch - Fix the `ScopeManager.active()` function returning closed spans.
- [6d2e2d5](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/6d2e2d5b02d2684401368e87eb367e380f451eb7) patch - Do not transfer closed spans for new async contexts in the ScopeManager. Rather than relying on `ScopeManager.active()` and `ScopeManager.root()` to make sure the span is not already closed, also make sure it's not closed when transferring spans around between async contexts.

## 2.3.6

### Added

- [33f7864](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/33f78644295bca0a8395b7600798506498cd9229) patch - Add the `createRootSpan` function to the Tracer to allow explicit creation of RootSpans even if another RootSpan already exists and is tracked as the current RootSpan. Make sure to not forget about the previous RootSpan, and close it as well at some point when using this function.

## 2.3.5

### Changed

- [fc9f2fd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fc9f2fd1936ed8abf0dee8e419d4d7eaa32efb03) patch - Use the Node.js performance module as high-resolution timer for span creation and close times. This provides more accurate times and improves compatibility with other systems in the future.

### Fixed

- [c2931af](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/c2931af6f66e8036c179e9e1f67153321d897414) patch - When instrumenting an outgoing HTTP request, read the `host` property from the request options if the `hostname` property is not present. This fixes a bug where outgoing HTTP request hosts would be shown as `http://localhost`.
- [4c57751](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4c57751afce5abf0e771ee21c858ce30e60760f9) patch - Fix error on Microsoft Windows machines on install. The AppSignal extension still won't install on Windows, but now it won't cause an error while checking a development mode condition if it should build the TypeScript package.

## 2.3.4

### Changed

- [ff871bf](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ff871bf7f268f53b83f0de0fcc39c47b832fd9a9) patch - Update node-gyp to major version `9.0.0`. This drops compatibility with Python 2.7 for the extension install, but it makes it compatible with the latest Python 3 version, which should be more accessible to users going forward.

### Fixed

- [817fdb4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/817fdb4f6c20ca64fe33205c5d15098a93bda7e2) patch - Ensure the root span is preserved across scopes. Due to a bug in the scope management logic, calling `tracer.withSpan` could cause the root span for a given scope to be forgotten.

## 2.3.3

### Added

- [8f745e6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/8f745e6c7d5b70ab01b6cdf87ae0afcbe66850a6) patch - Log messages are now sent through a new centralized logger that writes to `/tmp/appsignal.log` by default.
  A warning is printed to STDERR when the default or provided logPath is not accessible, and the Logger
  automatically falls back to STDOUT. Use config option `log: stdout` to log AppSignal messages to STDOUT instead.

### Changed

- [9a7fafe](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9a7fafed628ee1931dd70640f4da9f8ae4bc740e) patch - Bump agent to v-bbc830a
  
  - Support batched statsd messages
  - Set start times for spans with traceparents
  - Check duration in transactions for negative and too high values
- [df63d2d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/df63d2d79e1d5829264fc17fe88e6cabfc10edfc) patch - Bump agent to v-f57e6cb
  
  - Enable process metrics on Heroku and Dokku

### Fixed

- [4a498be](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4a498be6f43d4ebe1cf786d14d21aae7ab19a9b3) patch - Allow nested values in `Span.setSampleData`. This change also allows
  values other than strings, integers and booleans to be passed as values
  within the sample data objects. Note that not all sample data keys allow
  nested values to be passed.
- [4ab4814](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4ab481483e86425d1b6c072c4f85f88768c792c6) patch - Follow redirects when downloading the AppSignal agent. This fixes an issue where the redirect page would be downloaded instead of the agent, causing the agent installation to fail.
- [17c0deb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/17c0deb277fa53ba5cbce2cd0623e2af58cccace) patch - Fix an issue where the AppSignal extension would throw an error when an object containing a non-integer number is sent to it. This would be triggered when calling `setSampleData` with an object containing a non-integer number, or when the values for a metric's tags are non-integer numbers.

## 2.3.2

### Changed

- [7a7e5c5](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7a7e5c5b494922084e15d8cb84dc9de8673c3d33) patch - Update the expected Span type in ScopeManager to `Span` from the `@appsignal/nodejs` package, rather than the `NodeSpan` from the `@appsignal/types` package. The type definition is the same, but now all Span types used by the Node.js integration are defined in the `@appsigna/nodejs` package.
- [7fc5e40](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7fc5e40befca0cde2edb6d56ee3a12ad58fec06d) patch - Improve memory usage when extension is not initialized. It will no longer initialize a new empty Tracer object when the extension is not loaded or AppSignal is not active.
- [47a851b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/47a851b380516b7ac2129ec294cf65ac6329c1bd) patch - Update @appsignal/types dependency to 3.0.0.

### Removed

- [32d8054](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/32d8054e5613e11a77fa3d98f246c72d3f98efa0) patch - Remove the private function `Span.toJSON`. This wasn't previously marked as private, but it was.
- [178b49a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/178b49ac0bef06cbf8915e7727a82c69a142372d) patch - Do not ship the extension install script test files in the published package. Reduces the package size a tiny bit.
- [0af54b7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/0af54b735e9ad4f7ceb22352008d07ebadcba1a9) patch - Remove the unused experimental module.

### Fixed

- [083a39a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/083a39a159ed60fbbd615486b3e596e27b700b4e) patch - Show errors in loading the extension when the `@appsignal/nodejs` module is required.
- [afe221e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/afe221e2a892d4dda068637a3f60ac31447ac33f) patch - The minutely probes are now stopped when `Appsignal.stop()` is called. This fixes an issue where Jest tests would warn about asynchronous operations that remain pending after the tests.

## 2.3.1

### Fixed

- [531e5bf](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/531e5bf14b078c9294d61c71cd62948bb3f3608c) patch - The supported Redis version is now locked to 3.x.x. This will prevent app startup failures for users
  with Redis 4.x.x.

## 2.3.0

### Added

- [6d1cfec](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/6d1cfec83e8ca19331aa114fe7f85b4ea5a179f0) patch - Implement unregister method for probes. You can now call the
  `probes.unregister(name)` method to unregister a probe by name.

### Changed

- [4c453cc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/4c453ccf140c59090197a8ebfb79d39c77f31a91) minor - The extension package (@appsignal/nodejs-ext) is no longer a separated dependency.
  The extension is part of the @appsignal/nodejs package now.
- [675fa15](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/675fa1510dcc162adf87488fff07f237e2d3c8f0) patch - Update install report path location. The "nodejs" package now stores the install report in its own package path, with the rest of the extension files. This makes it easier to access by the diagnose report.
- [56fb794](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/56fb794a72e99d77f787000bf2a5bf95efc44565) patch - Improve the reporting of extension loading state in the diagnose report. Previously it would only report it as loaded when it was also running.
- [56fb794](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/56fb794a72e99d77f787000bf2a5bf95efc44565) patch - Change the way the extension is started. Previously it was started on initialization of the extension class (if the config was active), but now it's started by the client class.
- [733ee15](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/733ee15be5c548f8098a758307b70e58ae0b294f) patch - Remove the `os` and `cpu` fields from the `package.json`. This will prevent installations from failing on unlisted CPU architectures and Operating Systems. Our extension installer script will do this check instead. The package should not fail to install when it encounters an unsupported CPU architecture or Operating System.

### Fixed

- [fa955af](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/fa955af0a6f4378b0ec06aec3305095334eb81ad) patch - Add a hostname tag to V8 probe metrics. This fixes an issue where metrics' values
  would be overriden between different hosts.
- [72c54a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/72c54a4e3cc04b6e0fb1bb1a8c87b657e4bc7a37) patch - Setting `enableMinutelyProbes` to `false` now disables the minutely probes
  system. Custom probes will not be called when the minutely probes are
  disabled. In addition, the `APPSIGNAL_ENABLE_MINUTELY_PROBES` environment
  variable can now be used to enable or disable the minutely probes.
  
  Before this change, setting `enableMinutelyProbes` to `false` would not
  register the default Node.js heap statistics minutely probe, but custom
  probes would still be called. To opt in for the previous behaviour,
  disabling only the Node.js heap statistics minutely probe without disabling
  custom probes, you can use the `probes.unregister()` method to unregister
  the default probe:
  
  ```js
  const probes = appsignal.metrics().probes();
  probes.unregister("v8_stats");
  ```

It now always checks the actual log file's parent directory, rather than the configured path. These two values may differ as the package does a permission check to see if the `logPath` is writable or not.

  All Node.js-specific interfaces from the types package are now defined
  inside the nodejs core package. There's still a dependency from types
  package for common types as Func, HashMap, and HasMapValue.
  
  With this change, we keep taking advantage of interfaces, but now they're
  defined in a place where they're used.

## 2.1.1

- [42edcc0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/42edcc06b9258cc30ea13008d1f7ebc39332e28d) patch - Show correct language version in diagnose's extension installation section. It did not show the language version used during install, but the current one used to run the diagnose tool.
- [99b2f6c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/99b2f6cd6ca743d42c59587a05e979efe080797a) patch - Rename the `Agent` module to `Extension` to fit better with our naming standards.

- patch - Update @appsignal/nodejs-ext dependency to 2.0.2.

## 2.1.0

- [723b98d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/723b98d1370cb74d3d0198f4c7d49d08691095c2) minor - Add rootSpan and setError helpers.
  
  Errors added to child spans are ignored by the agent. Now the rootSpan is
  always accessible from the tracer object as well as setError. The setError
  function allows to track errors on demand and they will be always attached
  to the main current span, so they don't get ignored by the agent.
- [f0256d3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/f0256d3979fef129ded0644e712efbb96036967a) patch - Bug fix in custom timestamp calculation
- [1f182a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1f182a49548322b8af8ecec59ca5efe85cbebc29) patch - Deprecate the addError function on the Span interface. Instead use the Tracer's `setError` function to set the error on the root span.
- [96df8a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/96df8a43d7e9061233ac9ff9e5f2dde3c8d83ff7) patch - Add sendError helper to Tracer object.
  
  This new helper allows you to track an error separately from any other span
  inside the current context. Or use it to set up in your own error handling to
  report errors in a catch-statement if no performance monitoring is needed.
  
  ```js
  try {
    // Do complex stuff
  } catch (error) {
    appsignal.tracer().sendError(error, span => {
      span.setName("daily.task"); // Set a recognizable action name
      span.set("user_id", user_id); // Set custom tags
    });
  }
