## Installation

Please follow our [installation guide](https://docs.appsignal.com/guides/new-application.html) in our documentation.

## Development

### Installation

This repository is a [mono-managed monorepo](https://github.com/appsignal/mono/), containing packages (located in the `/packages` directory) that map to separate `npm` modules.

First install mono on your local machine by [following the mono installation steps](https://github.com/appsignal/mono/#installation).

Then install the dependencies and prepare the project for development use using mono:

```bash
mono bootstrap
```

You can then run the following to start the compiler in _watch_ mode.

```bash
mono run npm run build:watch --parallel
```

You can also build the library without watching the directory:

```bash
mono build
```

Version management configuration is provided for [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs).

### Testing

The tests for this library use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as the test runner. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the following command in the root of this repository to run the tests for all packages, or in the directory of a package to run only the tests pertaining to that package:

```bash
mono test
```

### Versioning

This repo uses [Semantic Versioning][semver] (often referred to as _semver_). Each package in the repository is versioned independently from one another.

# `@appsignal/nodejs`

![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@appsignal/nodejs) ![node-current (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@appsignal/nodejs)

The core AppSignal for Node.js library.

See also the [mono repo README](../../README.md) for more information.

## Installation

First, [sign up][appsignal-sign-up] for an AppSignal account and run our automated install tool, which will install `@appsignal/nodejs` and any relevant integrations to your project:

```bash
npx @appsignal/cli install
```

You can also skip the automated tool and add `@appsignal/nodejs` to your `package.json` on the command line with `npm`/`yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @appsignal/nodejs
npm install --save @appsignal/nodejs
```

Alternatively, you can manually add the `@appsignal/nodejs` package to your `package.json`. Then, run `yarn install`/`npm install`.

> Installing the AppSignal for Node.js integration builds a native extension. In order to compile it, macOS users will need to install the [Xcode Developer Tools](https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/). Linux users will need the dependencies outlined here. Windows is not supported.

You can then import and use the package in your bundle:

```js
const { Appsignal } = require("@appsignal/nodejs");

const appsignal = new Appsignal({
  active: true,
  name: "<YOUR APPLICATION NAME>"
  pushApiKey: "<YOUR API KEY>"
});

// ...all the rest of your code goes here!
```

> In order to auto-instrument modules, the Appsignal module must be both **required** and **initialized** before any other package.

## Extension

This package also contains the C++ extension, and the install script for the agent. The native extension is a bridge between the Node.js runtime and [our agent](https://docs.appsignal.com/appsignal/how-appsignal-operates.html#agent).
