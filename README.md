The core AppSignal for Node.js library.

## Installation

Please follow our [installation guide](https://docs.appsignal.com/nodejs/3.x/installation) in our documentation. We try to automatically instrument as many packages as possible, but may not always be able to. Make to sure follow any [instructions to add manual instrumentation](https://docs.appsignal.com/nodejs/3.x/integrations).

## Development

### Installation

This repository is a [mono-managed repository](https://github.com/appsignal/mono/). First install mono on your local machine by [following the mono installation steps](https://github.com/appsignal/mono/#installation).

Then install the dependencies and prepare the project for development use using mono:

```bash
mono bootstrap
```

You can then run the following to start the compiler in _watch_ mode.

```bash
npm run build:watch --parallel
```

You can also build the library without watching the directory:

```bash
mono build
```

Version management configuration is provided for [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs).

### Testing

The tests for this library use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as the test runner. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the following command in the root of this repository to run the tests for all packages, or in the directory of a package to run only the tests pertaining to that package:

```bash
mono test
```
